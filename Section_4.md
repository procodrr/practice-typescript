## Section 4.4

### 1. What is the purpose of Type Assertion in TypeScript?

- A. To create new types
- B. To force TypeScript to treat a value as a specific type
- C. To convert values at runtime
- D. To improve JavaScript performance

<details>
<summary>Show Answer & Explanation</summary>

✅ Correct Answer: **B. To force TypeScript to treat a value as a specific type**

Type Assertions tell TypeScript:

> "Trust me, I know what this type is."

```ts
let value = "Prashant";

(value as string).toUpperCase();
```

</details>

---

### 2. Which keyword is commonly used for Type Assertions?

- A. `assert`
- B. `cast`
- C. `as`
- D. `type`

<details>
<summary>Show Answer & Explanation</summary>

✅ Correct Answer: **C. `as`**

```ts
let value = "Hello";

(value as string).toUpperCase();
```

</details>

---

### 3. What happens here?

```ts
let num = 25;
(num as string).toUpperCase();
```

- A. TypeScript converts number into string
- B. TypeScript allows it because of assertion
- C. Runtime conversion happens automatically
- D. Number becomes string permanently

<details>
<summary>Show Answer & Explanation</summary>

✅ Correct Answer: **B**

Type Assertion does not perform conversion.

It only tells TypeScript to trust you.

```ts
num as string;
```

does not actually change the value into a string.

</details>

---

### 4. Which statement about Type Assertions is true?

- A. They perform runtime conversion
- B. They only exist during compilation
- C. They change the actual value
- D. They generate JavaScript code

<details>
<summary>Show Answer & Explanation</summary>

✅ Correct Answer: **B**

Type Assertions are removed when TypeScript compiles to JavaScript.

</details>

---

### 5. What is the output type of `userdata[0]` after assertion?

```ts
let userdata = ["Prashant", 20];

let name = userdata[0] as string;
```

- A. `number`
- B. `string`
- C. `string | number`
- D. `unknown`

<details>
<summary>Show Answer & Explanation</summary>

✅ Correct Answer: **B**

The assertion tells TypeScript to treat the value as a string.

</details>

---

### 6. Which statement is dangerous?

```ts
let userdata = ["Prashant", 20, 30];
```

- A.

```ts
(userdata[0] as string).toUpperCase();
```

- B.

```ts
(userdata[1] as number).toFixed();
```

- C.

```ts
(userdata[2] as string).toUpperCase();
```

- D. All of the above

<details>
<summary>Show Answer & Explanation</summary>

✅ Correct Answer: **C**

Index 2 contains a number.

TypeScript trusts us because of the assertion, but runtime may fail.

</details>

### 7. Why should Type Assertions be used carefully?

- A. They slow down JavaScript
- B. They can hide type mistakes
- C. They create memory leaks
- D. They prevent compilation

<details>
<summary>Show Answer & Explanation</summary>

✅ Correct Answer: **B**

Incorrect assertions can introduce bugs.

```ts
let value = 10;

(value as string).toUpperCase();
```

TypeScript trusts you, but the value is actually a number.

```ts
let user = {
  name: "Prashant",
} as const;

// Error
user.name = "Ankit";
```

</details>

---

### 29. Create a readonly tuple and try to use `.push()` on it.

<details>
<summary>Expected Answer</summary>

```ts
let values = [10, 20] as const;

// Error
values.push(30);
```

</details>

---

### 30. Create a variable whose type annotation overrides `as const`.

<details>
<summary>Expected Answer</summary>

```ts
let numbers: number[] = [10, 20, 30] as const;

numbers.push(40);
```

Because the explicit type annotation `number[]` takes precedence over the assertion.

</details>

## Section 4.5 and Section 4.6

### 1. What is the purpose of the Non-Null Assertion Operator (`!`)?

- A. Convert a value into boolean
- B. Remove `null` and `undefined` from a type
- C. Create a new type
- D. Make a variable readonly

<details>
<summary>Show Answer & Explanation</summary>

✅ Correct Answer: **B. Remove `null` and `undefined` from a type**

The non-null assertion operator tells TypeScript:

> "Trust me, this value is not null or undefined."

```ts
let value: string | undefined = "Hello";

value!.toUpperCase();
```

</details>

---

### 2. Which statement about `!` is true?

- A. It performs runtime checks
- B. It throws errors automatically
- C. It only affects TypeScript's type checking
- D. It converts undefined into a valid value

<details>
<summary>Show Answer & Explanation</summary>

- B. `string | number`
- C. `number`
- D. `string`

<details>
<summary>Show Answer & Explanation</summary>

✅ Correct Answer: **B**

The `!` removes `undefined` from the inferred type.

</details>

---

### 5. What does this mean?

```ts
nums[0]!;
```

- A. Array index definitely exists
- B. Convert value to boolean
- C. Create a readonly value
- D. Convert value to number

<details>
<summary>Show Answer & Explanation</summary>
